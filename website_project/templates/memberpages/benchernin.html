      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am an college undergraduate student attending East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania. I am currently majoring in Computer Science. My interests and hobbies include martial arts, web development, graph design, D&D and pretty much anything sci-fi or fantacy related.</p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>One day, I hope to become a proficient programmer in whatever field I choose. I wish to expose myself as much as possible to many different aspects of computer science so that I can find what's right for me. And maybe one day, if I have the time for it, I could run my own Taekwondo school part-time alongside my programming carreer.</p>

      <h3>Experiences</h3>
      <p>When it comes to Taekwondo, I have been training for over 15 years now and have been teaching it to others for over 10 years. When it comes to computer science, I realize that I do not have much in terms of proffessional experience. However, ever since I have picked up the major, I have tried to take every learning opportunity I can get and strive to become the best programmer I can be.</p>
